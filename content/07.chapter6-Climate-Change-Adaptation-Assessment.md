## Climate Change Adaptation Assessment

### Observed climate impacts
The general aspects of the climate and environment of Malawi have been covered in sections 1.1 and 5.1.1 above. In this section, emphasis is on the impacts of 
observed climate on the identified systems, for which the impacts of climate extreme events are summarised in Table XX below.

The average temperature in Malawi ranges from 8°C in the northern highlands to 38 °C in the lowland regions around Lake Malawi and the Lower Shire Valley (Nhamo 
et al., 2019). Since the 1960s, Malawi has recorded an annual mean temperature rise of 0.9°C (Parrish et al., 2020). Analysed data from 1960 to 2007 showed 
increasing drought frequency and intensity and the variability of rainfall, contributing to regional (SADC) insecurity of food and water (Godwell Nhamo & 
Muchuru, 2019). Malawi suffered seven severe droughts and 19 floods between 1967 and 2014 that adversely affected smallholders' production and food security 
(Haug & Wold, 2017). As a result, trends in people in need of food assistance (Figure 1) have increased between 2012 and 2016 (Haug & Wold, 2017).

Besides the severe droughts, frequent flood events remain a dominant impact of climate extremes in Malawi (Adeloye et al., 2015; IFPRI, 2020). Although local 
rainfall patterns are challenging to model accurately, an increase in the frequency and magnitude of drought and floods has been observed (Parrish et al., 2020). 
Malawi received the highest record rainfall for the country in 2015, causing severe flooding, especially in the Southern Region (Haug & Wold, 2017). During 
floods, agricultural losses are estimated at 3.5 to 8.2 % of GDP during RP5 and RP50 floods, respectively (IFPRI, 2020). According to Adeloye et al. (2015), 
rainfall in Shire of Malawi is about 2000 mm due to orographic influences. As a result, flooding is more prominent in the Shire valley. According to Malota and 
Mchenga (2019), the rural lower Shire Valley is most prone to flooding in the entire country - it registered almost three-quarters of the total flood-related 
economic losses in the past ten years. The Shire Basin is characterized by medium risk communities based on vulnerability and hazard - accounting for 8 of the 12 
communities assessed (Adeloye, 2015).  In the last decade alone, Malawi recorded an annual average loss of 12 % in maize yield production due to flood-related 
crop damage (Malota & Mchenga, 2019). The Mzuzu city experienced the worst floods ever recorded since its establishment in April 2016. Fifteen settlements were 
affected, 19,000 people were displaced, seven people were killed, and seven camps were set up to house the displaced (Kita, 2017). Figure 2 shows the percentage 
of households that suffered various flood-related shocks between 2016 and 2017 (Kita, 2017).  

In Malawi, agriculture is the foundation of the economy (Ajefu & Abiona, 2020). It employs 85% of the workforce and generates one-third of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) and 90% foreign exchange earnings (Msowoya et al., 2016).  Under the dominant land-use practice of ridge tillage, maize-based farming systems 
cultivated up to 80 % of the land area of the Lilongwe-Kasungu plains (Lark et al., 2020). Maize farming covers over 92% of Malawi's agricultural land and 
accounts for over 54% of the national caloric intake (Msowoya et al., 2016). In the last decade alone, Malawi recorded an annual average loss of 12 % in maize 
yield production due to food-related crop damage (Malota & Mchenga, 2019). Malawi recorded a deficient national average maize production of 0.76 tons per hectare 
(t / ha) in 2005, 40 % below the expected average (Msowoya et al., 2016). There was also overall maize (the staple crop in the region) deficit of 5.1 million t, 
a 10% decrease in production compared to the previous year and a 15% drop compared to the 5-year average (Nhamo & Muchuru, 2019). The average national production 
growth rate in the 1980s was 3%, followed by a production decline rate of 2 % per annum from 1990 to 1994 (Msowoya et al., 2016). Figure 3a shows the 
agricultural contribution of Malawi to the total GDP, indicating a good correlation between the economic growth of Malawi and agricultural production. In 
contrast, the changes in maize production in Malawi between 1980 and 2011 are shown in Figure 3b, illustrating the instability of maize production and the steady 
rise in maize prices over the past decades. Because of climate change, the Lilongwe District, Malawi's largest maize growing district, may decrease by up to 14 % 
by mid-century, rising to as much as 33 % by the end of the century (Msowoya et al., 2016). Small- and medium-scale farmers bear the brunt of floods, with 
recorded average annual production losses of 2.7 and 2.2 % respectively, compared to the small gains realized by large-scale farmers (IFPRI, 2020).

Climate impacts on biodiversity have also been recorded in Malawi. Declining lake levels in Lake Malawi has resulted in a subsequent decline in terrestrial and 
aquatic biodiversity (Aragie et al., 2018; GCF, 2017). It has been observed that an increase in temperature by 5 °C can reduce the lake level by 1.42 m 
(Mtilatila et al., 2020). Besides, eutrophication of lakes has led to reduced biodiversity (Hughes et al., 2019).  Malawian fisheries, particularly for most 
people living in rural areas, are a source of animal protein (Limuwa et al., 2018). However, between the 1970s and 2015, Malawians' fish consumption decreased by 
60 % due to low fish catches (Limuwa et al., 2018).

Droughts and floods, the leading climate impacts in Malawi result in elevated poverty levels (Actionaid, 2002). On average, poverty is 1.3 % higher due to 
droughts and 0.9% higher each year due to floods (IFPRI, 2020). Lack of access to water, food insecurity, and low-income levels at the household level 
accelerates poverty during extreme climates (Hughes et al., 2019). Table 1 demonstrates household livelihoods' exposure to climate risks in the past ten years 
(Abdi et al., 2020).
