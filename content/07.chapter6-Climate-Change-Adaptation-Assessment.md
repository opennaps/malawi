et al., 2019). Since the 1960s, Malawi has recorded an annual mean temperature rise of 0.9°C (Parrish et al., 2020). Analysed data from 1960 to 2007 showed 
increasing drought frequency and intensity and the variability of rainfall, contributing to regional (SADC) insecurity of food and water (Godwell Nhamo & 
Muchuru, 2019). Malawi suffered seven severe droughts and 19 floods between 1967 and 2014 that adversely affected smallholders' production and food security 
(Haug & Wold, 2017). As a result, trends in people in need of food assistance (Figure 1) have increased between 2012 and 2016 (Haug & Wold, 2017).

Besides the severe droughts, frequent flood events remain a dominant impact of climate extremes in Malawi (Adeloye et al., 2015; IFPRI, 2020). Although local 
rainfall patterns are challenging to model accurately, an increase in the frequency and magnitude of drought and floods has been observed (Parrish et al., 2020). 
Malawi received the highest record rainfall for the country in 2015, causing severe flooding, especially in the Southern Region (Haug & Wold, 2017). During 
floods, agricultural losses are estimated at 3.5 to 8.2 % of GDP during RP5 and RP50 floods, respectively (IFPRI, 2020). According to Adeloye et al. (2015), 
rainfall in Shire of Malawi is about 2000 mm due to orographic influences. As a result, flooding is more prominent in the Shire valley. According to Malota and 
Mchenga (2019), the rural lower Shire Valley is most prone to flooding in the entire country - it registered almost three-quarters of the total flood-related 
economic losses in the past ten years. The Shire Basin is characterized by medium risk communities based on vulnerability and hazard - accounting for 8 of the 12 
communities assessed (Adeloye, 2015).  In the last decade alone, Malawi recorded an annual average loss of 12 % in maize yield production due to flood-related 
crop damage (Malota & Mchenga, 2019). The Mzuzu city experienced the worst floods ever recorded since its establishment in April 2016. Fifteen settlements were 
affected, 19,000 people were displaced, seven people were killed, and seven camps were set up to house the displaced (Kita, 2017). Figure 2 shows the percentage 
of households that suffered various flood-related shocks between 2016 and 2017 (Kita, 2017).  

In Malawi, agriculture is the foundation of the economy (Ajefu & Abiona, 2020). It employs 85% of the workforce and generates one-third of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) and 90% foreign exchange earnings (Msowoya et al., 2016).  Under the dominant land-use practice of ridge tillage, maize-based farming systems 
cultivated up to 80 % of the land area of the Lilongwe-Kasungu plains (Lark et al., 2020). Maize farming covers over 92% of Malawi's agricultural land and 
accounts for over 54% of the national caloric intake (Msowoya et al., 2016). In the last decade alone, Malawi recorded an annual average loss of 12 % in maize 
yield production due to food-related crop damage (Malota & Mchenga, 2019). Malawi recorded a deficient national average maize production of 0.76 tons per hectare 
(t / ha) in 2005, 40 % below the expected average (Msowoya et al., 2016). There was also overall maize (the staple crop in the region) deficit of 5.1 million t, 
a 10% decrease in production compared to the previous year and a 15% drop compared to the 5-year average (Nhamo & Muchuru, 2019). The average national production 
growth rate in the 1980s was 3%, followed by a production decline rate of 2 % per annum from 1990 to 1994 (Msowoya et al., 2016). Figure 3a shows the 
agricultural contribution of Malawi to the total GDP, indicating a good correlation between the economic growth of Malawi and agricultural production. In 
contrast, the changes in maize production in Malawi between 1980 and 2011 are shown in Figure 3b, illustrating the instability of maize production and the steady 
rise in maize prices over the past decades. Because of climate change, the Lilongwe District, Malawi's largest maize growing district, may decrease by up to 14 % 
by mid-century, rising to as much as 33 % by the end of the century (Msowoya et al., 2016). Small- and medium-scale farmers bear the brunt of floods, with 
recorded average annual production losses of 2.7 and 2.2 % respectively, compared to the small gains realized by large-scale farmers (IFPRI, 2020).

Climate impacts on biodiversity have also been recorded in Malawi. Declining lake levels in Lake Malawi has resulted in a subsequent decline in terrestrial and 
aquatic biodiversity (Aragie et al., 2018; GCF, 2017). It has been observed that an increase in temperature by 5 °C can reduce the lake level by 1.42 m 
(Mtilatila et al., 2020). Besides, eutrophication of lakes has led to reduced biodiversity (Hughes et al., 2019).  Malawian fisheries, particularly for most 
people living in rural areas, are a source of animal protein (Limuwa et al., 2018). However, between the 1970s and 2015, Malawians' fish consumption decreased by 
60 % due to low fish catches (Limuwa et al., 2018).

Droughts and floods, the leading climate impacts in Malawi result in elevated poverty levels (Actionaid, 2002). On average, poverty is 1.3 % higher due to 
droughts and 0.9% higher each year due to floods (IFPRI, 2020). Lack of access to water, food insecurity, and low-income levels at the household level 
accelerates poverty during extreme climates (Hughes et al., 2019). Table 1 demonstrates household livelihoods' exposure to climate risks in the past ten years 
(Abdi et al., 2020).

Changes in rainfall patterns are highly variable (Hughes et al., 2019). Northern and Southern Malawi has experienced a drying trend since the early 2000s, while 
Malawi's centre has seen slightly increased rains. Reports of extreme weather events that is, droughts, heavy rains, and floods) increased from just one during 
the 1970s to between 2000 and 2006. Figure 4 presents the historical climate variability in Malawi between 1905 to 1998.

Severe floods have been reported to damage infrastructure in Malawi (Hughes et al., 2019). For example, the 2015 floods highlighted the transport sector's 
vulnerabilities with severe damage caused to the infrastructure. For the transport sector, the total damages and losses due to the disaster were approximately 
USD 60 million, while the cost of recovery was approximately USD 130 million, the highest among all the sectors. Flood events have also reduced electric 
generation from hydropower energy (Mtilatila et al., 2020). Malawi is close to the bottom of the United Nations Human Development Index league, and one of the 
world's lowest electricity access rates (Dauenhauer et al., 2020) exacerbates its extreme poverty levels. An estimated 16 million Malawians currently live 
without electricity or 91 % of the country's population (Dauenhauer et al., 2020). Reduced hydropower generation at the Lujeri Micro-Hydropower Scheme in 
southern Malawi during 1980–2011 was attributed to increased temperature (Mtilatila et al., 2020). 

Malawi has recorded 4,901,344 confirmed malaria cases and 3,614 deaths due to the disease were reported by the World Health Organization in 2017 (Frake et al., 
2020). Areas with the highest risk of infection are concentrated in the Shire River valley along the Lake Malawi lakeshore and the central plains, which are 
characteristically hotter and wetter than other parts of the country. According to Frake et al. (2020), for Anopheles gambiae s.s., 7.25 % of Malawi exhibits 
suitable water conditions (water only), approximately 16 % for water plus another factor, and 8.60 % is maximally suitable, meeting thresholds of suitability for 
water presence, terrain features, and climate conditions. Almost 21% of Malawi is suitable for breeding based on land characteristics alone, and 28.24% is 
suitable for breeding based on climate and land characteristics alone (Frake et al., 2020).

### Projected future climate
The temperature is anticipated to continue to rise by 1.1 to 3.0 ᵒC by the 2060s and by 1.5 to 5.0 ᵒC by the 2090s (Jørstad & Webersik, 2016).  On the other 
hand, by the 2090s, annual rainfall is projected to decrease throughout Malawi by -14% (Future Climate for Africa, 2019; GCF, 2017; Msowoya et al., 2016). 
Modelling of climate change scenarios predicts significant medium- and long-term changes to Malawi's climate, in terms of both temperature and rainfall (Jørstad 
& Webersik, 2016). Extremes in temperatures (that is, hot and very hot days) are also more likely to occur more frequently (Hughes et al., 2019). Figure 6 shows 
the potential highs and lows Malawi may face during the 2030s and 2040s. These extremes in temperatures can negatively affect the vulnerable, such as the old, 
the young, people living in poverty, and those with health issues. Extreme temperatures can also reduce water quality, cause surges in algal growth, and 
negatively affect aquatic ecosystems, including fish. Analysis of 34 climate change models projecting up to 2090 suggests more frequent dry spells and a 
reduction in the number of rainy days and the amount of rainfall each day (Figure 7). It also shows a greater likelihood of flooding. These changes are likely to 
threaten livelihoods, increase the risk of food insecurity, and negatively affect economic growth.

Rain-fed agriculture contributes 90 % of Malawi's food production. However, the incidence of extreme droughts and floods and extreme heat events is expected to 
increase (Hughes et al., 2019). According to Cacho et al., (2020), crop yields are expected to be below the no climate change reference scenario for most crops 
by 2050, with average yields as low as 0.83 compared to 2010 (Table 2). For the period 2020-2050, climate change's total cost to smallholders is $1.6 (± 1.3) 
billion in present-value terms (Cacho et al., 2020).

climate change reference scenario with CO2 fertilizer (± SD)

Figure 8. Figure 3: Average changes in the Lilongwe District's mid-and late century maize yields (%). Compared to the baseline period (1971-2000), the average 
maize yield reduction ranges for the 2050s and 2090s are 7%-14% and 13% -33%, respectively (Source: (Msowoya et al., 2016). 

Climate change impacts on infrastructure have been projected to reduce the growth rate of Malawi's GDP. Based on a comprehensive analysis using median climate 
scenarios directly related to changes in temperature and precipitation up to 2050, it has been estimated that, without adaptation measures to the planning, 
construction and maintenance of ad infrastructure, Malawi faces a potential annual average total cost of USD 165 million. The capacity installed and electricity 
generated at the hydropower plants in Malawi account for 80.2% and 98%, respectively, of the country's total electricity power (Mtilatila et al., 2020). 
Reduction in annual hydropower production between 1% (RCP8.5) and 2.5% (RCP4.5) during 2021–2050 and between 5% (RCP4.5) and 24% (RCP8.5) during 2071–2100 has 
also been projected (Mtilatila et al., 2020).

### Assessment by key systems
There are a number of key systems in Malawi (Table XX and Figure XX below on Malawi Systems). Each of these are addressed below and interlinkages between them 
are explored. Local and national economic development in Malawi depends on livelihoods from natural resources and food security. Systems that provide for 
livelihoods are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and overexploitation due to growing demand from rapid population growth. The NAP has been designed to 
capture the need to adapt in the critical subsystems of food production including crop, livestock, fisheries, and water resources. The food production system is 
strategically linked with economic value chains as broader market interventions at the macro level. The fisheries subsystem is complements with crop and 
livestock in livelihoods - as a source of income as well as a source of nutrition. Water resources support both agriculture (crop and livestock) and fisheries 
and has strong linkages across productivity and adaptation needs. Other systems under consideration include health, the hydropower, the sewage and waste, urban 
planning and development, and transport (Table 1).

#### Food Production Megasystem 
The Food Production System in Malawi is complex – highly fragmented and dependent on many small-scale producers who are often non-market oriented and vulnerable to 
climate change. This is on a background of many environmental risks that impose limits to systems productivity. A recent report on the Malawi’s Agri-food System 
(White, 2019) demonstrates the country’s agri-food system’s complexity in two fundamental ways (i) the country’s agri-food system comprises 80% of the population of 
about 18.1 million people consisting of smallholder farmers and many who work as food retailers, transporters, and small-scale processors. (ii) the country’s food 
production system operates in a complex policy debate about the role of subsidies such as the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) against priorities for Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) mitigation. For the purpose of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), this section limits description of the country’s food production system within the 
scope of crop, livestock and the fisheries and aquaculture subsystems from climate change adaptation context.  

The performance of agri-food system in Malawi is vulnerable to a high degree of uncertainty and volatility compounded with limited adaptive capacities, especially 
among smallholder farmers. This is because, the country’s agri-food system relies on rainfed annual agriculture production thriving in highly variable climate, 
compounded with the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). Many people, both urban and rural are perpetually vulnerable to an annual hungry season when the previous 
year’s harvest has been poor. Trends have shown that, malnutrition was steadily declining from a high of 26.3% in 1998, down to 12.1% in 2009, back up to 16.7% in 
2014, with undernourishment in 2015 staggering at 20.7% and declines remained slow in recent years. 

The volatility and precarity of the agri-food system is exacerbated by the combined impacts of poor infrastructure, uneven and deteriorating power access, expensive 
fuel, and poverty. Across the region, climate change is yet, expected to have widely variable impacts that generally exacerbate variability and extremes. The future 
impacts of the agri-food system can be reflected in the response of other subsystems such as energy and infrastructures (Table 1.1a-b).

#### Crop Production Subsystem 
Approximately, 90% percent of the crops are rainfed, and most farmers cultivate on small parcels of land of approximately 0.5 to 1.5 ha, although Lea & Hanmer 
(2009) note that many farmers in some parts of the country leave portions of their plots fallow, which is partially due to labour constraints (Bezner-Kerr & 
Patel, 2014). It is estimated that 11% of farmers are landless and only 13% of households cultivate on more than 2ha (Mangelsdorf, Hoppe, Kirk, & Dihel, 2014). 
Household land farms vary across the country – larger in the northern region than further south due to lower population density. Maize occupies at least 60% of 
cultivated land and is farmed by 97% of farming households. It makes up 60-70% of total food intake and 48% of protein consumption (Kampanje-Phiri, 2016). 
Average maize yields in Malawi are around 1.2 MT/ha, which is lower than the average for Africa, 1.8 MT/ha, also considered far below the average potential 
(Abate et al., 2017; Mango et al., 2018). 

Total cultivatable land is not fully explored in Malawi. Currently total land cultivated is about 2.5 million hectares (Agric-policy) but total suitable area for 
agriculture is about 4.7 million hectares. The cash crops like, tobacco, tea, sugarcane, and macadamia are cultivated in estate subsector. The estate subsector 
also provides contract farming opportunities for smallholder farmers. Out of the cultivated land 90% is under rain fed agriculture despite that there are 407, 
862 hectares of land that have the potential for irrigation farming. Out of the 400,000 hectares of land suitable for irrigation, only 14,000 hectares are under 
smallholder farmer irrigation while 48,000 hectares are under estate irrigation. This indicates a huge gap that can be addressed through investment.

With quantitative data available for eight soil and terrain factors, a recent study (Li et al., 2017)4  has indicated that highly suitable, moderately suitable, 
marginally suitable, and unsuitable agricultural areas account for 8.2%, 24.1%, 28.0%, and 39.7% of the total land area, respectively. The majority of suitable 
lands are currently used for agriculture, but more than half (57.4%) of Malawi’s total cropland exists on marginally suitable or unsuitable land categories and 
is likely a candidate for rehabilitation through sustainable agricultural practices, if the crop production subsystem is to adapt to climate change. 

Over the years the government has implemented agricultural input programs to improve agriculture production in the country amidst of the challenges. Most of 
these input programs have focused on Maize production the staple food. The main aim of these programs has been to improve the productivity of the smallholder 
maize farms so as to ensure food security. Since the early seventy’s the government has implemented six agricultural input programs which include:

- Agricultural Input Subsidy Programme: – subsidized seed and fertilizer for smallholder farmers (1970-1995) 

- Supplementary Input Programme: – Input kit distribution to vulnerable households (1995-1997).  

- Starter Pack Programme: – Universal distribution of fertilizer and seed (1998-99).  

- Targeted Input Programme: – Targeted fertilizer and seed distribution (2000-04). 

- The 2005 Extended Target Input Programme: – Expanded targeted fertilizer and seed distribution.  

- Farm Input Subsidy Programme: – Targeted voucher based maize seed and fertilizer subsidies (2006 to present). 

The main aim of these programs has been to improve the productivity of the smallholder maize farms so as to ensure food security. However, some of these programs 
did not achieve the intended goals hence they were phased out. For instance, despite having the Targeted input programme (2000-04) and the 2005 extended target 
input programme the country still experienced severe food crises in 2002 and 2005.  Currently, the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP) is being implemented where 
smallholder famers are provided with coupons which allow them to purchase hybrid maize seed and fertilizers at relatively low prices. The FISP programme has 
positive impacts on maize production and net crop income but limited impact on food consumption and household income (references). Furthermore, weaknesses of the 
programme have been pointed out including its financial sustainability and identification of beneficiaries (IFPRI, 2013), as there is high support to the middle 
income than the poorest. 

The constraints to expanding irrigation for agricultural production have been:  

- Focusing of the agricultural economy on rainfed agriculture and existing irrigation schemes, where emphasis was on funding extension activities.  

- Reluctance of donors to fund irrigation development.  

- Replacement of irrigation services under the Ministry of Agriculture, which has focused on rainfed agriculture.  

- Price setting for crops not viable for irrigation.  

- Almost no irrigation technology training facilities within the country.  

- A poorly funded and understaffed Department of Irrigation. 

#### Livestock Production Subsystem 
The livestock industry in Malawi is underdeveloped and contributes only 8% of total GDP and about 36% the value of total agricultural products. Both smallholders 
and estate farmers are involved in livestock production, but due to various production bottlenecks, intensive livestock production systems are largely dominated 
by estate farms. Despite that, livestock provides food, income, manure, animal traction and social security to some smallholder farmers. Considering all this, 
livestock may account more than 11% to Gross Domestic Production. Major livestock production comprise beef, dairy, goat, sheep, pigs, chicken and eggs, with 
registered small increases in recent years. Population of cattle has been increasing by 3% annually. In 2014 there were over 1.3 million cattle and over 6.3 
million goats in the country. Livestock production experiences varying challenges including: (i) limited pasture due to human population pressure (ii) inadequate 
production and storage technologies in feed and breeding programmes (iii) Insufficient health support infrastructure and services such as dip tanks. 

Spatial coverage of floods responsible for economic losses are generally localized in watershed areas. This limited coverage creates localized impacts such as 
crop and soil losses; hence the rating is medium. However, the impacts are felt on the national economy hence the rating is high. For example, on average, Malawi 
loses US$9 million or 0.7% of the GDP each year due to floods in the southern region of the country. Taken together, drought and floods cost the Malawian economy 
about 1.7% of its GDP every year. This is equivalent to almost US$22 million. 

Available literature agrees on the devastating impacts of frequent and severe floods and droughts on the agriculture sector in Malawi. The sector suffers the 
greatest losses, effecting declines in GDP ranging from 1.1 to 21.5% during Return Period of 5 years (RP5) and Return period of 25 years (RP25) for droughts, 
respectively. Furthermore, the literature and experts agree that low agriculture productivity resulting from climate change result in food shortages, cause 
domestic grain prices to rise while grain imports increase rapidly to cover the shortfall. Maize imports, for example, increase by between 6 and 256% during RP5 
and RP25 droughts, respectively. The possibility for high rating of the impacts implies that spatial coverage is at times wide, and frequency of the impact 
increases to high. For example, maize is by far the dominant crop produced in Malawi, occupying more than 70 per cent of available agricultural land and is 
critically important to livelihoods. The average land holding size per household for smallholders in Malawi in the period under consideration was 1.2 hectares. 
Over 90% of the total agricultural value-added came from about 1.8 million smallholders who on average owned only 1 hectare of land. Flooding in low-lying areas 
where productivity is inherently high affected almost the whole country in terms of food availability stability and accessibility. The alternation with droughts 
in the high areas complicates crop productivity. Floods wash away livestock in the low-lying areas. 

#### Agriculture Markets and Trade Subsystem 
Malawi is an export-led economy and agriculture comprises 80% of exports, with major export crop being tobacco, but sugar, tea, and coffee. The role of tobacco 
as an export crop is continuously declining. Smallholder rainfed maize production dominates and comprises about 25% of the agricultural GDP, of which agriculture 
as a whole makes up around 30% of the overall GDP (Pauw, Beck, & Mussa, 2016). At the farm level, net revenue varies widely and may be influenced by multiple 
factors such as soil conditions, farm size, infrastructure, distance to market, composition of the household, education levels, agro-climatic variability, and 
other variables.  

Transportation of agricultural produce/seeds and agriculture markets constitutes one of the components of the food production system. Agriculture produce is 
transported differently from the farm to the storage facilities or from the farm to the market depending on distance to be covered and on the financial capacity 
of the farmer. Among the modes of transport employed are; transportation by foot, bicycle, oxcarts and vehicles. Cereal crops are sold in different ways some are 
sold to the Malawi government through the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC). The ADMARC sells and buys produce from farmers at 
standardized prices. Other farmers who do not prefer to sell their crop produce to ADMARC usually sell at local markets or sell to vendors who usually move 
around villages searching for crop produce to buy. For cash crops like tobacco the government has established structures like the Tobacco Control Commission 
which regulate the sales of tobacco and facilitates exports of the produce.  

Sales of livestock and fish are usually done at local markets. For African smallholder farmers to sustain the yield increases they seek, they are reliant on a 
seed industry. On the other hand, a hybrid-based maize sector also requires large-scale commercial seed enterprises whose profits can be sustained only by strong 
seasonal demand by farmers for renewing their seed (Haggblade & Hazell, 2010). Leading Seed Companies in Malawi Multinational seed companies carry out seed 
breeding, production, multiplication, processing, and distribution of mainly hybrid maize. Local seed companies are involved only in seed multiplication and 
distribution. Malawi’s main seed companies are Seed Co, Monsanto (Bayer), DowDuPont (Pannar), Demeter, and MUSECO.  

_**The Country Vision on Trade._**

The Malawi Vision 2063 shows the country’s commitment to have an agricultural development and marketing entity running on commercial principles, promoting the 
commercialization of agriculture and providing local and international structured market linkages farmers. The parastatals shall operate under a strong alliance 
with the private sector, in a transparent and accountable manner and independent of political interference. 

Malawi is a member of WTO since 1995 and, in recent years has targeted trade-led development through trade expansion instruments, including regional trade 
agreements. The country also a Member State of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa4 (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community5 
(SADC), with each one accounting for less than a quarter of the country’s trade. Malawi is primarily a resource exporting country and features in the lowest 
quartile among its regional trade agreement (RTA) partners in terms of GDP per capita – in 2017, the COMESA average was US$2,900 and the SADC average was 
US$3,720. It is also a Signatory Party to the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons of the Kigali Declaration (2018) and to the 2018 African Continental Free 
Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). 

This active regional trade policy is remarkable and provides several trade-led opportunities for development. However, a variety of challenges and constraints 
continue to impede trade, such as licensing requirements and a system of trade permits.6 Efforts, such as single window, are underway to simplify border or 
certification procedures but, overall, there is a great deal of paperwork and specific certification regulation. In addition, standards-related regulations, and 
implementation, notably Sanitary or Phytosanitary measures (SPS) and other Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), can also be an impediment to the export of 
agricultural and agriculture-related products. Malawi also faces several infrastructure-related constraints including poor transport links and lack of access to 
electricity for a large proportion of the population - only 10 per cent have access - mirroring a trend in many African countries. On the other hand, over half 
of the population have access to radio and mobile phone services. 

Figure xxx displays the value-added breakdown of the Malawian GDP. The significant change in the aggregate economy since 2017 is characterized by a decline in 
the share of the industrial sector from 29% in 1990 to 15% in 2017 and an increase in the share of the services sector. from 26% in 1990 to 56% in 2017. The 
former can be explained by the small size of the sector and the relative expansion of world demand for certain basic agricultural products, which has led to a 
shift towards greater specialization in raw or semi-processed products. The increase in the contribution from services is striking at first, given that the 
sector’s predominance in generating value-added is generally a phenomenon of developed countries. The most dynamic over the past decade have been construction 
and sub-sectors such as wholesale and retail trade, real estate, information and communication and financial services. Growth in the services sector is believed 
to be driven by government expenditure as well as development assistance.3 The share of agriculture as a percentage of GDP has also seen a steady decline from 
45% in 1990 to about 28% in 2017.

#### Ecosystems
Ecologically sensitive and fragile ecosystems are facing threats due to poor land use practices and deforestation. Habitat fragmentation and loss threaten 
biodiversity. Deforestation is leading to the loss of mechanisms for adaptation from the increased impacts of severe flooding and excessive heat waves.

The Lake Malawi ecosystem is particularly an area of high freshwater biodiversity that plays a crucial role in the local economy of people living around the 
lake. It is however also under increasing threat from development, deforestation, hydropower development, oil exploration and multiple other interconnected 
factors. There is currently a lack of information and awareness of freshwater biodiversity within the region so existing conservation actions fail to recognize 
its importance and vulnerability.  

The country is committed to protection of ecosystems and the services. The national parks, wildlife reserves, and forest reserves cover 18% (1.7 million 
hectares) of the land mass of Malawi and a substantial proportion of the Shire Valley. Effective protection of these resources will continue to contribute 
significantly to address the drivers of climate change.  

Degraded ecosystems need restoration to maintain carbon storage and sequestration, and through best practice land management to combat degradation. Currently, 
forests are being lost and degraded at alarming rate, driven by a range of factors, including conversion for agriculture, overharvesting of firewood, cutting for 
charcoal production and increasing frequency of forest fires. Consequently, the country is experiencing unprecedented loss of habitat and their biodiversity.  

These factors are likely to intensify as population pressures continue to grow. Remnant forests decline in both quality and coverage and as changing climatic 
factors influence regeneration, forest fire frequency etc. Investing in the sustainable management and conservation of these remaining natural habitats, with 
strategies and interventions that are informed by climate modelling, offers a potentially cost-effective way of protecting ecosystem services and contributing to 
resilience. The Government of Malawi has developed a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to deal with threats to biodiversity including ecosystems.
